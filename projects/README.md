# Silice example projects

Looking at examples is a great way to learn and experiment. So I prepared several projects, from small to big, to show off Silice features. These projects are at various degrees of maturity and complexity, some have detailed explanations and code walk-through in their README (see list below). 

Note that these designs are entirely created from scratch with Silice, from SDRAM, HDMI, VGA, OLED/LCD controlers to dividers and multipliers, importing only tiny bits of Verilog (for e.g. PLLs). Most of the designs rely on common functions grouped in the `common` folder, which is a treasure trove of functionalities that can be reused in your own designs: UART, keypads, OLED/LCD screens controllers, HDMI, VGA, SDRAM controllers, etc. 

To build a design please refer to the [building](#building-the-examples) section below and the README of the project.
All designs can be simulated with Icarus/Verilator, and many will work right out of the box on real hardware. This directory also contains a `test_all.sh` script which is mostly meant for development: it allows to check that all projects still compile with the latest Silice version. It relies on a `configs` file defined in each project sub-directory.

A few projects rely on some external hardware (typical low cost peripherals: OLED, keypad, LCD 1602, etc.), this is all detailed in the README of the projects. See also the [peripherals](#peripherals) Section below.

## Building the examples

All examples are in the *projects* directory. 

To build a project, make sure your board is ready to be programmed, open a command line (MinGW64 under Windows), enter the project directory and type `make <target board>` ; for instance `make icestick`. 

Let's take an example! We will build the 'divint bare' demo for simulation with icarus. Do the following:

*Note:* under Windows please use a MinGW shell, please refer to the [getting started](../GetStarted.md) guide.

```
cd silice/projects/divint_bare
make icarus
```
If everthing goes well you should see in the last console output:
```
20043 /   -817 =    -24
```
and a gtkwave window opens to let you explore the produced signals.

A good project to start with Silice is *silice/project/blinky*.

## Peripherals

### VGA

Some projects require extra hardware, for instance a VGA DAC (a bunch of resistors on a breadbord will do!). This is simple and fun to do, so I highly encourage you [to make one](DIYVGA.md). You may also use a VGA PMOD on the IceBreaker, e.g. the one by *Digilent* works great (see e.g. the [terrain](terrain/README.md) project). 

All VGA and SDRAM projects can be simulated with the verilator framework (see next section), which opens a window and shows the rendering on screen. Most projects can also be simulated with Icarus, which outputs a fst file that can be explored with *gtkwave*.

### OLED

Some of the projects use a small OLED/LCD screen. I typically use a [128x128 OLED screen with a SSD1351 driver](https://www.waveshare.com/1.5inch-rgb-oled-module.htm).

The OLED/LCD screen library in `common` is compatible with multiple drivers (feel free to contribute more!). You may configure your OLED/LCD setup by editing the [common/oled.ice](common/oled.ice) to specify the driver and resolution being used. Note however that some projects have their own controllers.
The OLED/LCD library supports the SDD1351 and ST7789 drivers. Also checkout the specific pinout used for your board.

I now typically wire OLED/LCD screens with a four wire interface, as shown below for the IceStick. Most demos support this new pinout but please refer to each project README.
